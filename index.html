<ul>
<li>How to use Git to manage projects</li>
<li>How to publish a website using Github</li>
<li>How to manage content with simple Markdown text files</li>

<li>The pros and cons of using Git as a tool to manage, organize, and collaborate on the deployment of courses</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lectures-and-slides">Lectures and slides</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="lectures/git-github/intro-git-github.html">Introduction to Git and Github</a> : tools to collaborate and update content.</li>
<li><a href="lectures/pandoc-website/generate-materials.html">Using pandoc to automatically generate websites, presentations, and notes</a> : convert simple, portable, and accessible text formats like Markdown to &quot;prettier&quot; representations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="instructions-for-contributing">Instructions for contributing</h2>
<p>Only modify the markdown (<code>.md</code>) files, not the html or any other files.</p>
<h2 id="post-event-survey">Post-event survey</h2>
<p>Please fill out this <a href="https://columbiactl.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0GtCnIhJRtbHx7D">survey</a> after the event. This is my first time doing this, so feedback both helps improve and helps the CTL improve the Lead Teaching Fellowship program and support.</p>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> : version control software that manages projects and allows many people to contribute to a project.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> : a Microsoft-owned web platform that hosts Git-managed projects and provides tools for users to raise issues and questions on projects and merge their own changes to a project.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> : a simple plain text document format that is very portable and easy to modify.</li>
<li><a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> : tool to convert to and from many file formats. For example, it can generate PDFs, websites, and presentations from Markdown text files.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tools-to-automate-content-generation-e.g.-build-tools-these-might-be-os-specific">Tools to automate content generation; e.g. &quot;build tools&quot; (these might be OS-specific)</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>GNU/Linux and Mac OSX</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Gnu Make</a> : simple tool that automatically detects changes in source materials and re-compiles dependencies. In our examples, this involves automatically &quot;compiling&quot; websites and presentations using Pandoc whenever there are changes to the Markdown files.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Windows</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Any help from Windows users on what is used?</strong> Could install <code>make</code> with Cygwin, but seems overly complicated.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a> : an alternative to Microsoft's Github. A (possibly biased) comparison with Github is available on <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/devops-tools/github-vs-gitlab.html">Gitlab's website</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://shakebuild.com/">Shake</a> : an alternative build system to Make with a little bit more of a learning curve but with more features and the benefits of access to a full programming language in Haskell. I (Adam) use this primarily, mostly because I use Haskell primarily. Many other languages also have build systems, and it can be beneficial to use a build system embedded in the language you prefer (e.g. <a href="https://scons.org/">SCons</a> in Python, <a href="https://ruby.github.io/rake/">Rake</a> in Ruby).</li>
<li><a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org mode</a> - an alternative to Markdown with advanced personal organizational tools integrated into the Emacs text editor.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tutorials">Tutorials</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://guides.github.com/">Github guides</a> - collection of useful guides, some of which linked below.</li>
<li><a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">Github Hello World</a> : introduction to Github, and no text editor even required!</li>
<li><a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">Mastering Markdown</a> : Github introduction to Markdown format.</li>
<li><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial">Git tutorial</a> : in depth introduction to Git</li>
<li><a href="https://pandoc.org/getting-started.html">Pandoc Getting Started</a> : very thorough and accessible introduction to using Pandoc.</li>
<li><a href="https://pandoc.org/try/">Try Pandoc Online</a> : simple web application that lets you convert text between many formats. Also shows the corresponding Pandoc command for each conversion.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pros-and-cons-of-github-for-course-deployment-and-website-design">Pros and Cons of Github for course deployment and website design</h2>
<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>Students and contribute to course content, fix errors, and take ownership of the material in a unique way.</li>
<li>&quot;Issues&quot; page acts as a forum like Piazza: students can ask questions and answer each others' questions.</li>
<li>All course materials are in one place, rather than split across websites, Piazza, Courseworks, email, etc.</li>
<li>Students learn tools (Github, Git) that can benefit them in their academic and professional lives.</li>
<li>Course development is transparent: students and teachers can see the history of materials and when/why materials were changed, updated, or added.</li>
<li>Students get credit for their contributions in a formal way (&quot;contributors&quot; page).</li>
<li>All materials are publicly available (e.g. no uni required to access), so others can benefit from the course material.</li>
<li>Course materials are in an accessible and portable format. No proprietary software is required to access or read course material, like Microsoft office.</li>
<li>Facilitates collaboration between TAs and instructors in the development of course materials.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>Students must, depending on their background, learn a new tool.</li>
<li>Students are required to sign up for Github. While it is free cost-wise, some students may not want to sign up for another online account, especially one that is owned by a large corporation like Microsoft.</li>
<li>For many students the delivery of materials with Github may be new and disorienting, and could take some getting used to. This could negatively impact or disadvantage the students who are less familiar with Github and formats like Markdown.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="misc-contributions-andor-feedback">Misc contributions and/or feedback</h2>

<li>any random thoughts or contributions put here</li>

<h2 id="the-center-for-teaching-and-learning-ctl-and-this-workshop">The <a href="https://ctl.columbia.edu/">Center for Teaching and learning</a> (CTL) and this workshop</h2>
<p>This event is sponsored by the <strong>Lead Teaching Fellowship</strong>, which is a professional development program for graduate students at Columbia University committed to advancing pedagogy.</p>
<p>The CTL has a lot of great programming that I would recommend for anyone interested in teaching. Specific for doctoral students, there is the <a href="https://ctl.columbia.edu/graduate-instructors/programs-for-graduate-students/ctl-teaching-development-program/">CTL Teaching Development Program</a>, the <a href="https://ctl.columbia.edu/graduate-instructors/opportunities-for-graduate-students/lead-teaching-fellows/">Lead Teaching Fellowship</a> (sponsored this event), the <a href="https://ctl.columbia.edu/graduate-instructors/opportunities-for-graduate-students/teaching-observation-fellows/">Teaching Observation Fellowship</a>, and <a href="https://ctl.columbia.edu/graduate-instructors/opportunities-for-graduate-students/teaching-assessment-fellows/">Teaching Assessment Fellowship</a>. If you are interested in any of the fellowships, I think enrollment in the Teaching Development Program would strengthen your application.</p>
