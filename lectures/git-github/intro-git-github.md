Then we will go around the room and each person will introduce the
person they just met.

### What are Git and Github

-   Git is a software tool for collaborative software development. It
    has a command line interface and can also be used with cloud
    platforms like Github (see below). It tracks all changes made to
    files and can merge changes made separately by different people.

-   Github is a web platform owned by Microsoft that hosts Git projects
    and provides complementary tools.

## Sign up for Github

Please make an account at <https://github.com/>.

### Using Git and Github

-   If you have Git already installed on your computer, please feel
    free to use it if you feel comfortable.

-   If you do not have Git installed, everything can be done on the
    cloud using Github.

### Git definitions

-   **repository** : a directory of files tracked by Git
-   **fork** : a copy of someone else's repository in your Github
    account

----

### Git steps and terms

-   **git add** `<filename>` : add your file to a list of files to be
    committed
-   **git commit** : update the repository with your changes
-   **git push** : transfer your local changes to a remote repository
    like Github (backup)
-   **git pull** : transfer any remote changes on Github to your computer.

## Github features

----

### How can Github's features be useful (or painful) for deploying and organizing course materials?

-   Take a moment to write a few thoughts down on your own, in your
    text editor or on scrap paper (1 min)
-   Share your thoughts with the person next to you (3 min)
-   Group discussion (3-5 min)

----

### Let's collaborate on this workshop

1.   Fork the
    [repository](https://github.com/massma/ltf-github-website-courses).
2.   Enable Github pages
3.   On your version of the repository, edit workshop files (\*.md) to
     improve the workshop on Github.
4.   Or, if you installed Git you can clone your version of the
     repository to your local computer and edit with your text editor
     of choice. Recommended if you plan on using these tools a lot.

----

### Ideas for contributions

-   Add your name and uni to the attendees section of the website
    landing (index.md)
-   Improve any errors or confusing spots in the slides
-   Open an issue if something was confusing but you do not know how to
    fix it.
-   Add content to the [main
    website](https://massma.github.io/ltf-github-website-courses/index.html),
    or to some initial websites hosting resources
    for [EEAE
    students](https://massma.github.io/ltf-github-website-courses/index.html)
    and [Water Center
    people](https://massma.github.io/ltf-github-website-courses/sample-websites/water-center-resources.html).

----

### Let's merge our changes

-   Submit a pull request to my original repository, which will request
    to add your changes.
-   I will then re-generate content with pandoc (next presentation)
